# A description NOT written by ChatGPT ðŸ™‚:
  I lazily (beri: vibe) coded this for my part-time job, where I would follow the needs of my manager to see a daily and weekly view of their employees. I only implemented the necessary functionalities, keeping the app as simple as possible. After all, the app is meant to ease up a chore of managing employees' time, not waste more of your own (to learn how yet another app works - keep in mind this was made for non-technical staff). 
  This was my first beginner Python project, so the app is nowhere near perfect (ex. security could be heavily improved). 
  It was meant to run on localhost; therefore, I didn't bother with further deployment.
